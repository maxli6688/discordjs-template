# <samp>discordjs-template</samp> esm version

This repository references both the [DiscordJS-V14-Bot-Template](https://github.com/TFAGaming/DiscordJS-V14-Bot-Template) and the [DiscordBot-Template](https://github.com/NamVr/DiscordBot-Template), but it is written in ES6 modules.

A simplified and popular Discord bot commands & events handler built with discord.js version 14 and written in JavaScript. This handler can load up to 4 different types of commands: Prefix, Slash, User context, and Message context. It can also handle components, including Buttons, Modals, Select menus (any type), and autocomplete.

## Commands, events, and components structure

This Discord bot template uses CommonJS modules. You cannot use `import`, `export`, or any related keywords from the ES6 modules.


### Prefix commands:
```ts
export default {
    structure: {
        name: string,
        description: string,
        aliases: string[],
        permissions?: PermissionResolvable,
        cooldown?: number,
        globalCooldown?: boolean,
        ownerOnly?: boolean,
        developers?: boolean,
        nsfw?: boolean
    },
    run: (client, message, args) => void
};
```

### Slash/User/Message context commands:
```ts
export default {
    structure: SlashCommandBuilder | ContextMenuCommandBuilder,
    options?: {
        cooldown?: number,
        globalCooldown?: boolean,
        ownerOnly?: boolean,
        developers?: boolean,
        nsfw?: boolean
    },
    run: (client, interaction) => void
};
```

### Event listener:

The `...args` is a spread operator of arguments from the event chosen. For an example, if the event is **'messageCreate'**, the first argument is going to be type of **Message**.

```ts
export default {
    event: string,
    once?: boolean,
    run: (client, ...args) => void
};
```

### Component:

The `interaction` is the interaction of the component. For an example, if the custom ID is from a button, the interaction is type of ButtonInteraction.

```ts
export default {
    customId: string,
    options?: {
        public?: boolean
    },
    run: (client, interaction) => void
};
```

## Requirements
### Packages:
- **chalk** v5.3.0
- **discord.js** v^14.13.0
- **dotenv** v^latest
- **mongoose** v^latest

### Platforms:
- **Node.js** v16.9.0 or newer

## Setup
1. Install Visual Studio Code.
2. Download this project as a **.zip** file
3. Extract the .zip file into a normal folder.
4. Open VSCode, click on **Open Folder**, and select the new created folder.
5. Go to `src/config.js` and fill all the required values. You can use ENV instead of `config.js` to keep your bot token and ID, and your MongoDB URI in a secured place by renaming the file `.env.example` to `.env` and filling all required values.

> [!CAUTION]
> Sharing your Discord bot's token with anyone is a very risky move since you'll allow them to use your bot. This is also a dangerous move for the MongoDB database; we don't recommend using any public URIs or sharing your database connection URL.

6. Initialize a new npm package:

```
npm init -y
```

7. Install all [required packages](#packages):

```
npm install chalk@5.3.0 discord.js@latest dotenv mongoose
```

8. To start your bot, run `node .` or `npm run start`.
9. Enjoy. =)

## Hosting (<img src="https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/1111644651036876822/1124045180484472882/discloud_white_horizon-e96efbfa.png?width=960&height=163" width=100>)
Use [Discloud](https://discloudbot.com/)! A trust-worthy Discord bot hosting service.

1. Login using your Discord/GitHub account, and then don't close the Dashboard tab (because we need it later).
2. Go to your project on VSCode, create a new file `discloud.config`. This file is a configuration file for Discloud apps servers. The `discloud.config` file content must be like the codeblock below, and remember to change **YOUR_BOT_ID** to your actual bot ID.

```apache
ID = YOUR_BOT_ID
TYPE = bot
MAIN = src/index.js
RAM = 100
AUTORESTART = true
VERSION = latest
API = tools
```

3. Open explorer and navigate using the path of your project. Hold the **CTRL** key, and click on `src/`, `package.json`, and `discloud.config`. Now release the key, and right click on the selected files/folders and click on **Convert into .zip file**.
4. Go back to the Discloud dashboard, click on **Add App**, and then upload the .zip file in the upload box. Make sure to accept the ToS of the service and then click on **Upload**.
5. Wait for at least 20 seconds (depends on your Internet speed), and then your bot should be on.

> **Warning**
> Discloud has recently made every Free plan servers into **15 days** hosting only. Use the command `.rw` from their bot in the commands channel (on their Discord server) to reset the timer. Join the server: [Click here!](https://discord.gg/discloud-584490943034425391)

## FAQs
### 1. I'm getting this error: "Unable to load application commands to Discord API"
- The bot token and/or bot ID are invalid.
- The bot token and bot ID are not from the same Discord bot.
- Too many application commands.
    - 100 Global Chat input (AKA: Slash) commands.
    - 5 Global User context commands.
    - 5 Global Message context commands.
- Invalid application command structure.

### 2. I'm unable to view any application commands, no errors in console?
This is a common problem for developers, to fix this issue, restart the Discord app or go in a different text channel.

### 3. Is MongoDB required?
No, MongoDB is not required. There is an option to disable it in `config.js` so you will avoid errors from the commands that requires the database, such as `?prefix`. If you want to use the database, visit [MongoDB website](https://www.mongodb.com/).
